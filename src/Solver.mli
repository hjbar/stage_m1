          We propose an evaluation rule of the form
            [eval E[Do p] = NDo E[p]]
          where a [Do (p : ('a1, 'e1) Constraint.t T.t)] node placed
          inside an evaluation context [E] bubbles "all the way to the
          top" in the result. [E[p]] is defined by using [T.map] to lift
          the context-plugging operation
            [E[_] : ('a1, 'e1) Constraint.t -> ('a2, 'e2) Constraint.t]

  (** If [~log:true] is passed in input, collect a list of
      intermediate steps (obtained from the solver
      environment and the original constraint by
      constraint simplification) as the constraint-solving
      progresses. Otherwise the returned [log] will not be
      used and could be returned empty. *)
