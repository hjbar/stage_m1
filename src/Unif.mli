(** The Unif module provides unification, which is a key ingredient of
    type inference. This is exposed as a persistent "equation
    environment" [Unif.Env.t] that stores the current knowledge on
    inference variables obtained by constraint evaluation:

    - which inference variables are equal to each other
    - for each inference variable, its known structure (if any)
*)

type var = Constraint.variable

type repr = {
  var: var;
  structure: Constraint.structure option;
}
(** [repr] represents all the knowledge so far about an inference
    variable, or rather an equivalence class of inference variables
    that are equal to each other:
    - [var] is a choice of canonical representant for the equivalence class
    - [structure] is the known structure (if any) of these variables
*)

  val empty : t

  val mem : var -> t -> bool

      @raise [Not_found] if [x] is not bound in [env]. *)

(** Unification errors:
    - [Clash] indicates that we tried to
      unify two variables with incompatible structure
      -- equating them would make the context inconsistent.
      It returns the pair of variables with incompatible structure.

    - [Cycle] indicates that unifying two variables
      would introduce a cyclic, infinite type.
      It returns one variable belonging to the prospective cycle.

val unify : Env.t -> var -> var -> (Env.t, err) result
(** [unify env v1 v2] takes the current equation environment [env],
    and tries to update it with the knowledge that [v1], [v2] must be
    equal. If this equality would introduce an error, we fail with the
    error report, otherwise we return the updated equation
    environment. *)

val unifiable : Env.t -> var -> var -> bool
(** [unifiable env v1 v2] tests if unifying [v1] and [v2]
    in the equation environment [env] would succeed. *)
